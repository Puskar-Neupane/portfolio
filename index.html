        <ul>
            <li><strong>Virtual Oscillator Control for Inverters</strong> (Apr. 2023 – Mar. 2024)<br>
                Designed a VOC control system for a three-phase inverter and operated multiple of them in parallel. Analyzed the behaviors of a VOC (GFM) and PV (GFL) connected microgrid. Compared the performance of the VOC-integrated microgrid against conventional droop control.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Forecasting Losses in Magnetic Materials</strong> (Apr. 2023 – Dec. 2024)<br>
                Completed as part of IEEE PELS-Google-Enphase-Princeton MagNet Challenge 2023. Prediction of loss based on magnetic field, temperature, and frequency of operation. Used LSTM to train the model in the frequency domain.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Fabrication of Low-Cost LaApSi Model</strong> (Sep. 2023 – Dec. 2023)<br>
                Successfully created and produced a cost-effective laparoscopic appendicectomy simulation model designed specifically for surgical trainees in low and middle-income countries (LMICs).
            </li>
            <li><strong>Autonomous Driving Vehicle</strong> (Aug. 2022 – Mar. 2023)<br>
